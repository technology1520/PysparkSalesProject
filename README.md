# Sales Data Transformation & Dashboard Project

## Overview

This project is focused on transforming and analyzing sales data using DataBricks, a powerful cloud-based data engineering platform. The project leverages DataBricks notebooks for data transformation and a DataBricks dashboard for visualizing key insights.

## Notebooks

### [DataBricks Transformation Notebook](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/3819249739004715/1019424276933991/2596715857241290/latest.html)

This notebook contains the complete transformation logic applied to raw sales data. The notebook steps through the following processes:

- **Data Ingestion:** Reading raw sales data from various sources.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
- **Data Transformation:** Aggregating data, creating calculated fields, and filtering records.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generating new features to enhance data analytics.
- **Data Export:** Saving the transformed data for further analysis and visualization.

### [DataBricks Dashboard](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/3819249739004715/1019424276933991/2596715857241290/latest.html)

The DataBricks Dashboard presents visualizations of the key metrics and insights derived from the transformed sales data. Key components of the dashboard include:

- **Sales Performance:** Visualizations showing sales trends over time, comparison against targets, and performance by region.
- **Customer Analysis:** Insights into customer segments, behavior, and lifetime value.
- **Product Analysis:** Performance metrics for different products, including sales volume and revenue contribution.
- **Geographical Insights:** Sales distribution across different regions and potential growth areas.

## Sales Project Overview

This project is centered around a comprehensive analysis of sales data to identify trends, optimize strategies, and drive business growth. The video series from Data Academy serves as a foundation for understanding the various techniques employed in this project, covering:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Ensuring the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Identifying patterns in sales data to forecast future performance.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior to tailor marketing efforts.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Using historical data to predict future sales and customer behaviors.
- **Dashboard Development:** Creating intuitive dashboards for easy access to key insights and metrics.

This project is ideal for those looking to enhance their skills in data engineering, analytics, and dashboard creation using DataBricks.
